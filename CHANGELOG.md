# v4.0.0
#### Notes
Major release which extends support of the SDK to OneView Rest API version 500 (OneView v3.10).

#### Major changes
 1. Extended support of SDK to API500.
 2. Added CHANGELOG and officially adopted Semantic Versioning for the SDK.
 3. Updated example files for most resources for improved readability and usability.
 4. General cleanup and removal of deprecated methods and classes.
